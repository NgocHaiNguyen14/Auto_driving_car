# Auto_driving_car
## Introduction
This repository is devoted for auto driving car project, which belong to SEFAS.
The source code for the project include: Simulation, Hardware, Middleware and Software.<br>

## Hardware
In hardware folder, we have the datasheets of sensors and devices of the system.<br>
    - Camera 3D <br>
    - LiDar <br>
    - Servor motor <br>
    - BLDC motor <br>
    - Drivers for DC and Servor motors <br>
<br>

## Middleware
In middleware, we have the programs of the controller and ROS, which handle the tasks controll the hardware devices, connection and communication between parts of the system.
<br>
    - Camera 3D <br>
    - LiDar <br>
    - Controll Servor motor with driver <br>
    - Controll BLDC motor with driver <br>
## Software
In software, we have programs for artificial intelligence tasks. <br>

<br>


**Note**: All programs have been completing and updating
